# Tamagotchi
---
A basic virtual pet simulator, you need to take care of pet needs in order to be successful in the game. I chose to make this game because as a kid i loved playing with my tamagotchi, keeping it alive gave me a sense of responsibility in a fun way. To win the game you need to keep Jakey's stats above a certain point, if the the stats fall to 0 you will lose!
