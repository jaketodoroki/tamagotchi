tamagotchi
A basic virtual pet simulator, you need to take care of pet needs in order to be successful in the game. I chose to make this game because as a kid i loved playing with my tamagotchi, keeping it alive gave me a sense of responsibility in a fun way.

technologies used: JS,HTML,CSS

future enhancemennts: i would like to add a level up function, that changes the state of the pet similar to the original tamagotchi, i would also like to add music.
